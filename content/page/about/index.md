Hi, I’m Amir Candido—a self-taught web developer based in Edmonton, Canada. I’m passionate about creating well-architected, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I’ve spent the past eight-plus years honing my craft, primarily in PHP, Javascript, WordPress, and WooCommerce development.

## What I Do

- **Web Development:** I specialize in developing and optimizing custom WooCommerce solutions, and integrating APIs for seamless functionality.
- **Front-End & Back-End Expertise:** With a strong command of PHP, JavaScript (including ReactJs and NodeJs), and MySQL, I design full-stack solutions that cater to modern web standards.
- **API Integrations:** I’ve worked extensively with RESTful APIs—including those for Wordpress, WooCommerce, as well as coding APIs from scratch.
- **Cloud & Tools:** As an AWS Certified Solutions Developer and Associate, I leverage cloud services alongside tools like Docker, Git, and Chrome Web Developer Tools to streamline development workflows.

## My Background

Over the years, I’ve built my career by embracing challenges and continuously learning. I’ve had roles as a remote freelance developer and collaborated with companies across the globe—from Germany to South Africa and Canada. These experiences have not only sharpened my technical skills but have also equipped me with the ability to work effectively both independently and within teams.

## Freelance Opportunities

In addition to sharing insights and trends through my blog, I actively use this platform to connect with potential clients and explore new freelance opportunities. If you're looking for a dedicated developer to bring your web project to life, I’d love to chat about how I can contribute to your success. Feel free to reach out directly through my contact information or connect with me on GitHub and WordPress.

## Certifications & Continuous Learning

I firmly believe that growth never stops. I’m proud to hold several industry certifications, including:
- AWS Certified Solutions Developer Associate
- AWS Certified Solutions Associate
- Magento Certified Developer
- Zend Certified Engineer for PHP
- Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)

These achievements reflect my commitment to staying ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

## Outside the Code

When I’m not deep in a project or solving a complex coding challenge, I love sharing my insights through my blog. It’s a space where I discuss web development trends, best practices, and personal experiences from my professional journey. I also contribute to the open-source community on GitHub and keep active on platforms like WordPress.

Feel free to explore my [GitHub](https://github.com/amir-candido), [WordPress profile](https://profiles.wordpress.org/amir_canteetu/), or drop by my [blog](https://amircandido.tech/). I’m always eager to connect with fellow developers, share knowledge, and collaborate on exciting projects.

Welcome to my corner of the web—let’s build something amazing together!
